# Snake-
This is a remake of the famous game Snake using JavaFX and a showcase for a layout manager I created in the process called YeldorGrid. 

The game operates on a class I created called YeldorGrid, which is a layout manager for JavaFX. It is dependant on true XY coordainates
defined by the user and is great for similar projects.

No external libraries are needed. Only the Java Standard Library (ones that include Javafx i.e SE8), the YeldorGrid class and the snakeGame class.

:)

I made the personal choice to not animate the snakes motion/ make him consistently moves on the users last key pressed for
learning purposes of any novice programmer.

This program is only for educational use!
